# Basic-Portfolio

##Overview: 
Homework assignment #1 - build a professional portfoloio site based on a provided style guide.

## Technology 
* HTML
* CSS

## Comments
* I made some style changes as I wanted the pages to reflect me better. 
* I added comments throughout the CSS file to make it easier to navigate.
* I used this assignment to experiment. For example, I added someone else's code for `hover` effects on the Portfolio page.

## Challenges
* No matter how much research I've done, I could not create a sticky `footer`. I left it in the `fixed` position for now.
* I struggled with responsiveness. For example, `h1` is not positioned directly above the main content container. This is because when it would be in the correct position on one screen, it would move out of place when the browser was minimized.

## Feedback

Please comment on the general code structure. I'm expecially eager to get an input on using the `float` and '`position` properties correctly.
